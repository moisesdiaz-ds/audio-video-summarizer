00:30.000 --> 00:54.000
I can't see anything, after all, I don't want to see anything

00:54.000 --> 01:04.000
It's a convenient world, isn't it? It's so painful, it's more painful than being in the water

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm so tired of believing, that's how I've been doing it

01:10.000 --> 01:20.000
Isn't this world strange? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?

01:20.000 --> 01:29.000
Isn't it good to cry? I want to cry, but there's no one

01:29.000 --> 01:41.000
What do you want in this world? Is it okay to live? Is it okay?

01:41.000 --> 01:51.000
It's painful, it's painful, it's red, it's red, but it's so easy to be crushed by the rain

02:11.000 --> 02:32.000
If you don't have a tomorrow, then that's okay

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
After all, nothing has changed, and my heart is about to break apart

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
Why is it so painful? What is not enough for me?

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Can't you make it? All you can do is laugh

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Who made this world?

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
I want to laugh, I want to cry

03:03.000 --> 03:30.000
Isn't this world strange? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?

03:30.000 --> 03:53.000
Why are you laughing? Isn't it good to cry? I want to cry, but there's no one

03:53.000 --> 04:06.000
What do you want in this world? Is it okay to live? Is it okay?

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
I want to laugh, I want to cry

04:11.000 --> 04:27.000
Isn't this world strange? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
I want to laugh, I want to cry

04:48.000 --> 04:56.000
Isn't this world strange? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?

04:56.000 --> 05:16.000
Why are you laughing?

05:26.000 --> 05:49.000
Why are you laughing?

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Why are you laughing?

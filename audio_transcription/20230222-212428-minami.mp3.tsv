30000	54000	I can't see anything, after all, I don't want to see anything
54000	64000	It's a convenient world, isn't it? It's so painful, it's more painful than being in the water
64000	70000	I'm so tired of believing, that's how I've been doing it
70000	80000	Isn't this world strange? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?
80000	89000	Isn't it good to cry? I want to cry, but there's no one
89000	101000	What do you want in this world? Is it okay to live? Is it okay?
101000	111000	It's painful, it's painful, it's red, it's red, but it's so easy to be crushed by the rain
131000	152000	If you don't have a tomorrow, then that's okay
152000	161000	After all, nothing has changed, and my heart is about to break apart
161000	168000	Why is it so painful? What is not enough for me?
168000	174000	Can't you make it? All you can do is laugh
174000	178000	Who made this world?
178000	183000	I want to laugh, I want to cry

210000	233000	Why are you laughing? Isn't it good to cry? I want to cry, but there's no one
233000	246000	What do you want in this world? Is it okay to live? Is it okay?
246000	251000	I want to laugh, I want to cry
251000	267000	Isn't this world strange? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?
281000	288000	I want to laugh, I want to cry
288000	296000	Isn't this world strange? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?
296000	316000	Why are you laughing?
326000	349000	Why are you laughing?
356000	360000	Why are you laughing?

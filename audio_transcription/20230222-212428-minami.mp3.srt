1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can't see anything, after all, I don't want to see anything

2
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's a convenient world, isn't it? It's so painful, it's more painful than being in the water

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm so tired of believing, that's how I've been doing it

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Isn't this world strange? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Isn't it good to cry? I want to cry, but there's no one

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What do you want in this world? Is it okay to live? Is it okay?

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's painful, it's painful, it's red, it's red, but it's so easy to be crushed by the rain

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you don't have a tomorrow, then that's okay

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
After all, nothing has changed, and my heart is about to break apart

10
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why is it so painful? What is not enough for me?

11
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Can't you make it? All you can do is laugh

12
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Who made this world?

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I want to laugh, I want to cry

14
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Isn't this world strange? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why are you laughing? Isn't it good to cry? I want to cry, but there's no one

16
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What do you want in this world? Is it okay to live? Is it okay?

17
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I want to laugh, I want to cry

18
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Isn't this world strange? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?

19
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I want to laugh, I want to cry

20
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Isn't this world strange? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing?

21
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why are you laughing?

22
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Why are you laughing?

23
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why are you laughing?
